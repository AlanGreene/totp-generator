# Generate TOTP pass codes in the browser

[Demo site](https://totp.danhersam.com/)

This page lets you easily generate a time-based one time code (TOTP) entirely in the web browser in case you ever lose access to your phone.

It uses the excellent [otpauth](https://github.com/zant95/otpauth) package, downloaded from [raw.githubusercontent.com/zant95/otpauth/master/dist/otpauth.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zant95/otpauth/master/dist/otpauth.min.js).
